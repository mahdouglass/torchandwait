Before this session, one of the players had informed me that his brother was interested in playing with us. Adding a character at this point was mostly ideal. This is because there was a momentary pause before the characters were set to go forward while following the cult of the dragon. Adding a character can be hard because it changes the dynamic of the players. This was hard for me because when Nysvyre was added, even though it was only the second session, it meant that the players would have to adjust their play style as a new player enters. However, this new character would be added after nearly two months of playing. That presented a potential strain for the party from a comfort standpoint.



Added the player was the trick. There are many ways to simply add a hook to get a player included. But, I prefer not to force players into a story they don’t care about. That happened to me once and I, personally, didn’t enjoy it. I felt as though I was playing someone else’s character rather than a part of myself that I fed into a storyline. So, I was curious how I was going to incorporate this new character.



As I reached out, the player mentioned that he was interested in playing either a kalashtar or satyr wild magic sorcerer. With a paladin, bard, warlock, druid, and rogue in the party, adding any class wouldn’t be much of a concern. Both of the races could be interesting from a storyline standpoint. He settled on satyr and we began brainstorming his background. The nice thing is that the player was very communicative and understanding that he was joining into the middle of a game and didn’t want to screw things up.



A posed a background story for how Tilin came to be with the party. Since a Satyr is fey (which potentially ties into Amaranth’s background) it is simple enough that Tilin’s wildmagic sent him from the feywild to the material plane. Then, he was hunted as a fey creature, managed to survive, escape, and was recaptured. This is where the session would pick up.



With that background, the players woke up in the inn. Cora snuck out early to mail a letter (which cost quite a bit based on distance). She ended up having to sell a gem to the local smith to get enough money. Nysvyre had gone off to pray. There was a commotion in the tavern that sounded like a horse being paraded around the main floor. Arguments could be heard through the halls. Amaranth had gone down and heard the complaints of Isobel with one of the local guards. Isobel was complaining that the poor boy doesn’t deserve to be shackled like a criminal and condemn. The guard mentioned that there was no reason to interfere. The world would be better off with fewer fey creatures in it. This caught Amaranth’s attention.



Amaranth, luckily, caught the hint. He inquired about the individual and asked about a description. He pressed the guard for information and rolled quite well. Finding that the captor’s took their quarry down the eastern road, Isobel pleaded with Amaranth to go save him. At this point, most of the party was waking up or returning to the Chirping Griffon. As Amaranth was pressing for everyone to hurry and get ready, the party geared up and set off. Obviously, they left most of the stuff behind because they wanted to hurry. Amelrelle, however, mentioned that she would catch up.



The party rushed to the east. Most of the morning passed as they rushed down the soaked road. Eventually they caught up to the captured fellow and his captors. The party scoped out the individuals before them, five in all. This was supposed to be a conflict that could be resolved through bribery. However, with poor charisma rolls, the interaction quickly became a fight. But, this was really one-sided. Why? Because Amaranth summoned a badger. He wasn’t supposed to be able to do this without a gilded acorn, but I neglected to look at the spell components. The badger could have single-handedly dominated the fight with a series of critical strikes, but the party made quick work of the captors. The Satyr scurried off during the scuffle behind some gathered rocks.



The captor’s revealed that they were members of the hunter’s guild of Iriaebor who had been hired to capture the satyr. They were tasked with returning him to his master. As the party sent the captor’s off with brutally injured individuals, the cart eventually disappeared in the distance.



The party eventually was able to engage in a discussion with Tilin the Satyr about his past. The only thing he could think of was that Amaranth had gone south. Tilin was emaciated during his flight and was caught near the town of Greenest. I had expected at least one member of the party to react when I mentioned that they heard the sound of hooves in the main floor of the inn, but no one did. This was supposed to allow the party to stay in Greenest and follow the tracks of the cult of the dragon to their camp. However, parties have a habit of doing unpredictable things. Especially when you’re not as familiar with the players.



Now, the party was many miles East of Greenest. They could turn back or continue onward. At this point, I elected to introduce the party to a hex crawl. I had done one before in a campaign I had been a player in at this point and thought that it was an interesting idea. The party elected to continue down the road. Having heard that there were settlements near Greenest, they thought that they might be able to find refuge and supplies. They did not expect that many of these settlements had fallen prey to the cult. In fact, one of the settlements on the road had fallen victim to bandits who opportunistically raided the settlement during the siege on Greenest. The party was walking into the mouth of a serpent.



The arduous, rainy, muddy trek to the ruined town ended after a long night. The party had elected to march through the night and were about to suffer a level of exhaustion. They decided that they needed to sleep. They found that there were a number of people in the town center who were cooking, eating, and laughing. I had expected there to be a fight that I could have instigated, but let the players decide what they were going to do. This was a fatal flaw.



For nearly an hour, I narrated as the players went from building to building investigating the ruins. They wanted a place to sleep that had protection from those in the town. Since Amaranth could enter “sentry’s rest”, he could protect the party as they attempted to rest. As the party discovered a number of bodies, the bandits (who the party believed to be townspeople who were survivors perhaps?) watched and laughed. Eventually, they found a place to rest and the I ended the session.



It was a long journey. Honestly, I felt that it was a little boring for a new player to join. But it gave him time to watch the party dynamic and get a sense for how I run the campaign. There’s a lot of freedom I give the players, but I noticed this time that there was too much freedom. I should have given the players what they were looking for much sooner once they had described it to me. Unfortunately, I didn’t think of that at the time. But, with six players now in tow, there was a hex crawl to prepare.
