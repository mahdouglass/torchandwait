**Education**

I got my bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics, a minor in Economics. Then, I continued to get my Ph. D in Mechanical Engineering. What does this mean for gaming, probably nothing.

**Home**

I have a beautiful wife who was the first player who agreed to participate in my first campaign. I also have an awesome, 1-year-old son who has graciously agreed to sleep at night and allow us to play. Unfortunately, I do have to shut my office door to prevent my two cats from walking over my plans during gameplay.

**Hobbies**

I always enjoy creating games. Probably the most exciting thing that I am working on is an Augmented Reality play setting for tabletop games. While this exists on a monitor, I'm working on making this a reality for the hololens.
