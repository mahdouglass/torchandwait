As I began to give out experience, the characters were already reaching level 2. While the adventure as written states that with the milestone experience method the characters wouldn’t reach level 2 until the end of the chapter, I decided to give experience per session. One of the primary reasons that I chose to do this was the fact that I wanted to encourage role-playing. While people in the forums will always disagree when it comes to the appropriate approach, I wanted to give feedback to my characters. This means that I would both give additional experience if the players acted true to their characters or went above and beyond in doing something admirable. But, one of the other things was the consequence of falling unconscious or another traumatic event.

Falling unconscious to me is like a near-death experience. Your body is broken and your mind exhausted. This shouldn’t be something that the characters can shrug off. Of course, the argument would be that the front-line characters are more likely to fall unconscious and therefore would suffer more. My counter to this is, OF COURSE! It’s hard being in the frontline. You need support from your rear to avoid collapsing. If the frontline falls, there is a good chance the whole party is going to fall. In other words, it happens.

So why do I bring this up? This book is dastardly. The amount of battles and opportunities to get wiped in even the first chapter is great. Even step of the way, the characters are trying to figure out how to get healed. The bard has some healing, the druid has some healing, and the newly acquired paladin has some healing. At this point though, no long rests are available with everything that has been going on. After taking a short rest, Cora got her spells back. Some hit dice were thrown to recover some health. Even the clerics of the garrison were able to lend a helping hand. But, some really bad persuasion rolls on the part of the part failed to produce any potions of healing, again.

As Cora waited at the top of the parapet, the first to return was Amelrelle and Amaranth. Followed soon after by a slightly bloodied pair of Nysvyre and Ijaia. They reconvened at the parapet and recounted their experiences (apart from Cora, of course). The group gathered and proceeded to the dungeon were the entrance to the old tunnel had been discovered. With the key in hand, they were able to get through the nearly sealed portal. With a groan, the grate opened and the party encountered something for the first time. Dynamic lighting. 

In many campaigns, the idea that you can’t actually see your target doesn’t really do much. I’ve seen situations where a character would have no idea of the presence of the target and still make an attack. This is mitigated by saying something along the lines of “Okay, but you have disadvantage.” Dynamic lighting provides a remedy for this because of the constant need for lighting. Some of the characters have darkvision, others have nothing. So when they went into the old tunnel for the first time, a few of the characters said, “I can’t see anything.” I replied, “Do you have darkvision?” The reply, “No.” The answer, “Then that make sense, doesn’t it?”

One of the characters reminded me that they had grabbed a torch from the stairwell. With that, the party had light again. However, that light caused the bats in the tunnel to stir. Two swarms of bats began to assail the party. Having been the first time dealing with damage resistances, where I did not realize it until the very end, the bat swarms were defeated pretty quickly. The characters noticed that there was a trail of blood leading down the tunnel that stopped at a seemingly deceased rat. Amaranth performed a medicine check and found that the giant rat was bleeding out, but was not dead. 

Let’s lean into Amaranth’s caring nature. Taking pity on the rat, he healed the creature and began speaking with it. The dialogue was simple, Amaranth trying to communicate as Nysvyre, the new resident intimidator, indicated that he was glaring at the rat. The rat, with pretty good perception and having been bloodied by the guy, immediately proceeded to play dead. Conversation over.

I could have decided that the rat just got shy from Nysvyre, but speech of the woods is pretty particular. It’s not a verbal as much as a behavioral language. Thus, when someone intercedes with the conversation, it makes it difficult to do that. While Nysvyre probably didn’t intend to have that consequence, I made it clear from the start of the game that actions have reactions. This was probably the first instance of such a thing, but it definitely wouldn’t be the last. Granted, Amaranth was only going to ask where the exit of the tunnel is which ended up being just around the corner. They didn’t know that at the time. Queue Amaranth being annoyed.

Walking ten feet forward, they found the exit to the tunnel. Using the key they received, the old lock managed to turn. But, it didn’t open. This was one of the deviations that I made from the book. When Nysvyre joined, he told me that he had played some of the Hoard of the Dragon Queen. To keep the party on their toes, and potentially confuse Nysvyre, I added some things that require a little extra attention. In this case, the fact that the grate was actually held shut by both the lock and the various roots that were wrapped around the edge of the rusted exit.

Though the key turned, the grate didn’t budge. This led to Nysvyre to push a little harder on the grate to open it. Successfully, he pushed the grate door open as metal squealed and roots tore. Here is an interesting point. In Nysvyre’s previous game, he knew that opening the grate poorly would attract attention and they would be ambushed by cultists. The great players that he did, didn’t let on that this was going to happen. Nysvyre went out of the grate. Just as he expected, a couple of kobolds and three cultists were waiting for them.

As the party was nestled in the tunnel, it was a bottle neck for them. Combat started quickly with the kobolds shooting at them with slings. Nysvyre managed to avoid many of the errant attacks as Cora sought cover in the bushes. As the party had only a short rest, this seemingly trivial battle became increasing difficult as hit points were already lost. Amaranth cast his spirit totem, giving everyone temporary hit points. One cultist fell, his body being swept downstream. The other stood strong, though favored retreat. One of the cultists stood back on the bank. As the party continued the fight, struggling to attack the kobolds from afar, something odd happened. The cultist attacked the kobolds.

The party, a little more wounded than I expected but bolstered by the spirit totem, went to speak with this lone cultist who stood there in a purple robe. Cautious, the party told the cultist to lay down his weapon, which he did. The party cautiously approached the hooded fellow. He seemed calm and careful. To start the conversation, he said, “Quickly, I know that they are attacking the sanctuary.”

The team was ready to kill the cultist, I could tell. There were definitely some questions that people couldn’t get direct answers too, though they were more than willing to help villagers however they could. Without missing a beat, just as I wanted, one of the party members says, “Who are you?”

“Marius,” he responded.
