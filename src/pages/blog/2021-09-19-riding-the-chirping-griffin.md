Each of the characters at this point were finally given the opportunity where there wasn’t an immediate threat, nothing to chase, no one begging for a reprieve. This stillness was broken by the request to follow the cult of the dragon to determine what information they could. If possible, recover some of the goods that had been stolen from the town, but that wouldn’t be a high priority. Governor Nighthill would understand if the party wasn’t up to the challenge, but was willing to pay them. But there was another problem. A young monk, obviously injured, came to the party asking if they had seen a half-elf named Leosin. Leosin was doing research about the cult of the dragon and he can’t be found. He assumes that the cult took him as one of the prisoners, among the many that were carried off, and he is in great danger. This was one of the hooks that would likely sink with at least two of the party members. Amaranth and Amelrelle have a background that highlights having been slaves at one point.



While it is always interesting to see how players react, it is useful to give breadcrumbs specific to the players. I find that money isn’t always the solution for players. At this time, the book encourages the DM to offer a reward for finding the monk and recovering what information they can. I felt as though the freeing of slaves in a desperate situation fit the narrative for some of the players and the cash payout fit the narrative for others. At this, Nesim returned to the sanctuary. Coincidentally, Nysvyre went with him. It should be noted that Nesim first left for the sanctuary and then Nysvyre decided that he wanted to go to the sanctuary. This put the scene in such a state that Nysvyre was awkwardly following a man through the town that he was just talking to, but not actively engaging with Nesim on the way. This captures the essence of Nysvyre.



As Nysvyre went to the sanctuary, he inquired about purchasing some prayer material and whether there were any holy artifacts that could be useful. This would have been a good opportunity to give the party a magic item, but I decided against it. That decision made sense because the sanctuary had been sacked. As Nysvyre prayed to Tyr, he made a connection that Tyr was pleased with him. “I am pleased with you Nysvyre, now bring me your allies to prove your resolve.” I was excited to see how Nysvyre would persuade the rest of the party to join him in a prayer. Nevertheless, Nysvyre asked about whether they could have one of the carts. Since one had been smashed and burned, the other needed repair. Unfortunately, Nysvyre wasn’t able to repair the cart alone. He would need some help.



Amaranth did something unexpected (not so much in hindsight). He decided that he was going to go to the couple and their child that they found on the way to the town. The night before, Amaranth had found them in dire straits and he used a spell early on to heal them. Now, he was looking for the couple and in time he would find the villagers gathering supplies from a ransacked house. As the man looked at Amaranth, his eyes couldn’t believe that it wasn’t a dream. The man pulled what he could, all that he had perhaps, and offered it to Amaranth. His eyes welled with tears at the protector that stood before him. This captures the essence of Amaranth.



While Nysvyre came to the Chirping Griffon, he happened upon Amaranth and took him back to the sanctuary to fix the cart that the group had previously persuaded the cultists to break for firewood. Luckily, Amaranth had the mending spell. Together, they fixed up the cart and made some friendly bonds as well. Now, the party had a cart for all their stuff that they were going to be getting.



Cora, having been the first in the party to get level three, was finding the new opportunity to engage with the other party members. The new pause in activity gave her a chance to ask questions about these random companions that she met not more than a day before. At this point, there hadn’t been time enough to ask what they were doing there, but the time had come. Cora, though, has a hard time withholding the truth. It was also apparent that Amelrelle saw what she had done to Marius. As the party was looking for a place to stay, they found the Chirping Griffon. Ijaia sat with a bard in the corner of the room and took the opportunity to take Amelrelle aside for a quick conversation. At this point, Cora divulged that she had to kill Marius because he was following orders. When Amelrelle asked if she had been asked to kill before, Cora said that she hadn’t. Amelrelle instinctively asked what she would do if she was asked to kill the others of the group. Cora was sheepish with that one. Then, Amelrelle persisted and Cora said, “I don’t want to take over the world. It seems like a daunting task.” This captures the essence of Cora.



Capturing the essence of Ijaia was a little bit harder. The player who plays Ijaia had never seen herself playing dungeons and dragons, but was having fun with the interactions. Of all the players, there was little backstory and Ijaia basically clung to Cora to maintain that connection. This made her reactive as a player, which is fine. During my discussions with the player, I mentioned that perhaps Ijaia is more forward looking rather than dwelling on Ijaia’s history. This could offer greater potential for growth and not need to develop background. So, I wanted to give Ijaia a prophecy. This led to the creation of Ludovicus.



As the players entered into the Chirping Griffon, the room was bare except for two people. The first was the innkeeper, Isobel, and the second was a man sitting in the corner. Spying Ijaia’s large panflute, he beckoned her over to have a drink with him. He asked about the instrument and Ijaia saw that he had two drinks in odd looking cups. He asked her to sit down, saying that she appeared as though she had a story to tell. Ijaia was cautious and wanted to see if there was something off about the cup. Finding nothing, she brought the drink to her lips. Then, the following occurs:



“In an instant, the mystic reaches out and you are encased with a black shroud. Intangible, impenetrable, you can only see faint glimmers between now shifting sands. In a moment, you see a stout halfling holding an iron key. In that moment, fire stings your skin and the smell of blood wafts through your nose. The halfling turns toward you, the key slipping from between her fingers. The remnants reform to a swirling dust that keeps you from reaching out toward the halfling whose eyes only just meet yours before you slip from view. You lurch forward, your footsteps falling on soft ground. Above you, magnificent ribbons of light dancing through the air drift in your direction. Nearing you, the ribbons fade to grey, then erupting in embers. Your eyes raise to see an imperious tree, towering before you. Roots spread at your feet, tendrils sinking through the moss. You feel rumbling as you turn to your back. Wild, rampant magic untethered in form dissipates from before a shadow moving towards you. Just in your reach, you push out instinctively to keep the shadow from attacking. Your fingers slip through as the shadow erupts, transforming to liquid spilling on the ground. As you step erratically trying to find its sunken escape, you see blackness creep through the roots guiding to the tree. An unseen force cuts at the roots, failing to stop the creeping blackness. Leaves begin to fall, swirling into a mass that encompasses you. A deep stillness draws, disturbed by a rhythmic breathing. Before you, a large, narrow eye matches your gaze. Rising overhead, the eye blinks away, fading into the distance, joined by four others. A deafening roar bellows as you fall to your knees. You find yourself returned. You look at the mystic, a tear falling from his eye.”



I thought that this approach added something specific to Ijaia that would tie in other elements of the story that were planned, but not set in stone. Thus, the vision is fluid and allows for interpretation. At the end of the campaign, the players should be able to look back at this vision, whether or not Ijaia survives, and have an “aha!” moment. While perhaps not as significant as Cora’s blackout moment, this brought Ijaia to level three and she chose the Bard of Lore subclass.



Amaranth wanted to ask this traveler about some of the things Ludovicus had mentioned. Amaranth followed Ludovicus to his room and had a conversation about his origins which Amaranth cannot even remember. He mentioned the Gold Elves of the High Forest and even the Grandfather Tree. But it is not Ludovicus’ story to tell and this was told to Amaranth. He must return to his origins to uncover the truth. There were many things I could have added to this for Amaranth, but unfortunately, it came and went. In hindsight I could have done much better. But Amaranth made it to level three nevertheless. I feel as though the experience of saving the family was probably the best moment for Amaranth becoming level three.



As the party sat down to eat and drink, finishing up their conversations, it was the end to their first calm session. No combat. Just fun NPCs that have meaningful stories for them to spend their gold supporting. The player characters decided to sleep at the end of the session and would have an interesting start to the next session.
