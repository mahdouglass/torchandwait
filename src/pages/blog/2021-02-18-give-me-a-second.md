The work that went into the first session was not too daunting. I had the flexibility to prepare what was going to happen. As the game was planned two weeks out, I had enough opportunities to put things together. I had ideas what to do for the second session, but I really didn’t know where the party was going to get to. But that wasn’t the only thing to happen. One of the players had a sibling who wanted to join the game.

At this point, I wasn’t afraid of another player. However, this was the first player that would join my game that I had never met. There was a considerable amount of anxiety about personality types, the strangeness of having a character join at this point, and how would the group dynamic change. I didn’t want to deny someone the opportunity to play with us. Part of me was excited to have another player. So I agreed to have them come aboard.

The new PC would be Nysvyre, an Aasimar Paladin. The introduction to the game hinged on the fact that Nysvyre was basically conceived with this campaign in mind. In fact, the player had played this campaign before. Suddenly, my brain started to think differently. I needed to ensure that the players were all surprised. I didn’t want to run a boring game and I didn’t want to have a player (however unintentional) to make decision based off of previous experience. The introduction to the game would be rough, but what I had in store would be rougher.

In the campaign, there are a series of events. One of the things I noticed is that the introduction to this campaign is pretty unforgiving. There isn’t a healer in the party and I wasn’t going to bestow potions of healing on the party just because they didn’t have a healer. Two of the party had healing word and with a paladin, there’s more healing there. The series of events stresses immediate action and doesn’t really allow for rests. I wasn’t about to allow for a calm to enter into the game.

And so the second session was about to start. I asked whether Nysvyre would want to join the campaign in two different ways. The first would be that Nysvyre would be in the keep having heard that the cult of the dragon was in the area. The second, the more fantastical, was that Nysvyre was following the cult of the dragon and saw the attack at the keep. I had told him that this would happen during this session and that he would be introduced as the combat started. As Aasimar get wings eventually, I allowed Nysvyre to have wings for the fight with one condition. That is “If you attack the dragon, the dragon will attack you.” It was an ominous warning, though he understood. It was an outrageous introduction, but it would be epic. Sometimes, we need those epic moments.

The four players started in the keep, introducing themselves to the masters of the keep and noting the desperation of the guards. The Halfling was suddenly experiencing short-jokes that I have grown accustomed to using on my wife, although I should have suggested that Halflings were more common than I let on. I did my best to express the desperation of the guards. One of the guards, a main NPC named Escobert, was introduced. Suddenly there was a call of attack.

At this moment, I set a timer. I had played out this scenario beforehand. There were flying kobolds attacking archers on the keep. If the players didn’t react to the call of attack, then a turn would pass. Escobert would leave the parapet and go support the archers. Surprisingly, the players decided to keep talking to governor Nighthill. A few rounds passed, a few archers fell to urds (flying kobolds) before the characters finally went out to the parapet. They saw the archers and urds and Amelrelle rolled perception. She noticed shining metal nearby as she inspected and noted that there were grappling hooks on the wall. There was one turn left before six enemies mounted the parapet. Had they moved quicker, they would have been able to clear the grappling hooks entirely. Only two were cut.

Suddenly, a dragonclaw, a kobold and 3 cultists were on the parapet. This wouldn’t be troublesome if the players were ready. When the dragonclaw reached the top, he saw the adventurers and blew a horn. The players didn’t understand what this meant. A voice cried out, “Lennithon! The time is now to attack the parapet!” Basically, Mondath had received word from the kobold in the first session that adventurers were helping Greenest. If the players had been able to remove the grappling hooks before this announcement, Lennithon would have come later.

With that, the party had to fight a number of enemies and a dragon. The dragon was not really a problem for about 6 rounds. If the party was unable to deter it before then, I would have the dragon kill the party. At this point, Nysvyre flew to the parapet, using his scimitar to slice one of the cultists to ribbons. What a start.

Rolling each of the turns at this point was daunting. The archers and urds, Escobert, the cultists and dragonclaw all had separate initiatives and attacks. Frustrating to say the least. Time for a new system, though I couldn’t imagine what (More on this later. But if you’re curious, Combat Tracker DNDbeyond). The party this session could not hit a thing. Moreover, they were punching bags for the enemy. Amelrelle was knocked unconscious. Ijaia healed her. Knocked unconscious immediately again. Escobert nearly dies and flees instead. Cora tries to attack the dragon but can’t get over the armor class. Dragon is destroying archers left and right.

Then, a miracle happens. It was one more turn before the dragon would turn on the party. Ijaia decides to take a shot at the dragon. Natural 20. A critical hit was one of the retreat conditions for the dragon. This 100% saved the party. Once this happened, the sallyport was broken down. Archers were dead, PC’s were bleeding out, everyone was exhausted. The cultists were repelled by guards and the ranged attacks from the PCs who had ranged attacks to give. The party was exhausted, but nobody died.

A conversation after the game revealed an interesting sentiment. Some members of the party thought that the dragon was just flair. They didn’t quite understand the lethality that was flying above them. Why? Because I threw so many things at them at the same time that they didn’t consider it. I told them that if Ijaia hadn’t gotten the critical hit, then the party would have wiped. It might have been asking a lot to have the party deal with such a threat in the second session. It might have been difficult for them to understand the problems that came along. This entire engagement might have been a huge deviation from the campaign as written. However, they survived. The entire engagement took the majority of the session.

The keep was besieged and the PCs needed to go save more villagers. Nysvyre was the only one who thought to grab a grappling hook. They considered scaling the wall. One asked whether there was another exit. Escobert remembered an old tunnel somewhere in the keep, but couldn’t remember where. He gave the party the key and Cora took it. Cora decided to take a short rest while Nysvyre and Ijaia went to the basement to search. Amelrelle and Amaranth went to the courtyard to search. Amelrelle found an oubliette that contained weapons which she originally didn’t loot (I didn’t include anything a rogue would want). Amaranth helped mend the sallyport.

Meanwhile, Nysvyre and Ijaia were searching the basement and came across three giant rats. Ijaia at disadvantage attacking in the dark listened as Nysvyre slashed at the rats. One survived and disappeared from the room. Moving boxes and barrels, they found the old tunnel. Everyone converged back to Cora.

It was a long session and filled with crazy disorganization on my part. I’m not sure if the players felt it, but my brain was scrambled egg afterward. I did things out of turn, spontaneous enemy events, a bad treasure hoard, and a lot of dice rolling. The session ended and I was back into the shower. When I made it to bed, I was thinking of all of the things that I had done wrong. I prayed that my players had fun, but it was a lesson in organization. Hopefully this would get easier in time. Two sessions down, but things demanded attention. The next week would include some amendments. Stay tuned.
