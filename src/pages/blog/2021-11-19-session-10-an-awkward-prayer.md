The first shopping episode! There’s a great chance to role-play during shopping episodes, though it is difficult to stay interested for many players. In a campaign that I participated in, there were definitely players that checked out during the whole process. For me, I enjoyed going to each individual store and interacting with the different shops. This is an endurance challenge for the DM to act out different characters. This would be more true depending on how varied the DM wants the stores to be. It would be easy enough in some circumstances to have a “general store”.



But this is not that kind of world. I wanted to allow my players to choose how they interacted with a variety of people. I created a number of stores, probably too many for Greenest. Honestly though, the village has a keep. Thus, there can be a larger variety of stores than one would expect.



As the players ventured out, Nysvyre returned to the sanctuary to entreat upon Tyr. As a paladin of Tyr, Nysvyre has played the character very purposefully. Much to the delight of my other players, Nysvyre has had a very one track mind. Find the cultists that destroyed his temple. Returning to the temple, I had given Nysvyre’s player a message. “Bring your companions to me. Have them join you in worship.”



I thought this would be a fun little trial. First, I wanted to ensure that Nysvyre was talking to the other players. This would require him to establish a relationship and break out of his inward facing, cultist-hating, kobold smashing paladin of vengeance self.



In the meantime, Cora and Ijaia were going around town. Now level 3, the characters (specifically Cora) was showing off to Ijaia some of the new tricks she had picked up. Their primary purpose was going out into town to gather supplies, including rations and wood for burning. Why wood for burning? Because if you’re not comfortable in camp, your rolls for succeeding a long rest suffer. However, Ijaia’s player is my wife. Thus, I took a few opportunities to have npc’s cat-call her. She took it in stride and really let her Goliath nature shine.



Amaranth and Amelrelle were taking care of gathering other supplies and buying items. Not much story to tell there. However, the party eventually came back together and decided that they were going to go visit the “Naughty Rook”. I hadn’t expected Amelrelle to remember the note that I had given her earlier on, but she did. As the players saw the myriad of weird supplies that had been discarded and appeared as garbage, the character’s with proficiency in thieve’s tools noted the potential uses. The “Naughty Rook” is a fence. The clerk seemed to be less enthusiastic about the visitors, but with the devastation of Greenest, this wasn’t too surprising. But, surprising, the store only seemed to suffer superficial damage.



As Amaranth and Amelrelle were browsing, they came across a familiar symbol on the wall. One they would recognize as belonging to the “Shades of Penumbra”. This was a symbol that they may have been looking for since the tragedy that they suffered. Perhaps here they would be able to gather more information. However, they were not about to do it with the rest of the party present.

Buying a few things, such as a bag of ball bearings, the party returned to the inn. There, we all received the privilege of listening to Nysvyre try to convince the party members to gather with him in prayer. What followed was an awkward attempt at convincing a rogue, warlock, bard, and druid to come together to pray. Each of the characters were amusingly hesitant, but eventually relented.



Nysvyre gathered everyone around and began reciting a prayer that he had written for the occasion.



“With proud thanksgiving, a father for his children, Tyr mourns for his dead across the sea. Flesh of his flesh they were, spirit of his spirit, Fallen in the cause of justice. Solemn the drums thrill; Death august and royal Sings sorrow up into immortal spheres, There is music in the midst of desolation And a glory that shines upon our tears. They went with songs to the battle, they were young, Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow. They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted; They fell with their faces to the foe. They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old: Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning We will remember them. They mingle not with their laughing comrades again; They sit no more at familiar tables of home; They have no lot in our labour of the day-time; They sleep beyond Toril's foam. But where our desires are and our hopes profound, Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight, To the innermost heart of their own land they are known As the stars are known to the Night; As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust, Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain; As the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness, To the end, to the end, they remain. (Adapted from Laurence Binyon’s “For the Fallen”)”



As the prayer concluded, the players were suddenly spirited away to a distant plane. Surrounding them was the illuminated pathways, embers, and smoke. Before them stood a great hall. Approaching the doorway, there stood Tyr, the maimed god, with singular hand rebuked a chained woman. Her hair black and skin pale, she looked down with condescension at the adventurers.



Tyr enchants the Holy Avenger Scimitar that Nysvyre wielded (a request from the player when he joined the campaign that I obliged). As a reaction, Nysvyre could use a charge from the scimitar to give advantage to creatures within 15 feet to dexterity saving throws. In this realm, characters would automatically save the saving throw and take no damage if they would have taken half damage. The idea was that this trial was to have the other characters show faith in Nysvyre.



Tyr asked who would stand by Nysvyre’s side and Amaranth stepped forward. None of the other players did at this time. Tyr glared at Nysvyre and the iron bands that bound the woman erupted and shattered.



The woman transformed into a Red Dragon and cast Fire Breath. Nysvyre activated the scimitar and saved a few members of the party who were close. Cora and Ijaia decided to stay back at the doorway and avoided the blast all together. Cora didn’t trust this one bit and wasn’t about to go in.



Once damage was done to the dragon, the image shattered and reformed into a blue dragon. Lightning breath erupted. Nysvyre again used the scimitar. Together, the continued attacking these dragons. However, at this point specifics did me in. When the black dragon came and forced a constitution saving throw, I realized that I screwed up. The special event I had made was quickly falling apart as a back-tracked, retconned, and quickly edited things. I decided that it wasn’t worth the effort and quickly terminated the dream. The woman was meant to represent the avatar of Tiamat and a foreshadowing of what they would face. However, I could have done better in hindsight.



Tyr approached Nysvyre and said, “One among your companions has shown faith in you. You have a long way to come. You cannot complete this task alone.” This gave Nysvyre one charge of the Holy Avenger Scimitar per day that recharged at dawn. This was dependent on the number of players that went to him in the beginning. It seemed appropriate for this level though. In the end, it worked out.



As we flash back to the party in the inn, in a circle at the conclusion of the prayer, I told them that they had no memory of the other plane or what had happened in the “dream”. However, Nysvyre did. As they looked around themselves, Nysvyre crying, it was a supremely awkward and satisfying moment.
