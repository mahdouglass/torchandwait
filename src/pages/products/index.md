      text: DNDbeyond (https://www.dndbeyond.com/) is one of the greatest resources
        that I have had to use during my campaign. My campaign uses DNDbeyond to
        manage character sheets and roll dice. I use this tool extensively to
        create homebrew material that is then available to the players. This
        helps stay organized and helps when a player isn't present to manage
        their sheet.

        Inkarnate (https://inkarnate.com/) has been one of the tools that I've
        used to create battlemaps. Even with the limited selection of an
        unsubscribed user, there are a number of possibilities to bring the
        world to life. With a little skill, you can add depth and create large
        scenes where range actually becomes an issue. Wait, your longbow has
        disadvantage and that enemy is out of range? You better believe it.

        Roll20 (roll20.net) is where I bring my players together. At least, for
        ambience music and the battlemaps I create. It also helps me let the
        players know who is in the scene and speaking at any given time. More
        importantly, it allows them to see the rolls I make so when you forget
        to disengage from that Ankheg and it scores a critical hit and almost
        outright kills you, you know I'm not lying. To connect DNDbeyond with
        roll20, I use beyond20. It is a fantastic tool. I still use dice on the
        side, but it helps maintain transparency when I feel it is necessary.

      text: Discord is where I host my audio. Why discord and not roll20? Discord is
        convenient as I know that players may want to call in rather than sit at
        a desktop for audio. Shopping episode? Yep. It's also a good forum to
        have a conversation between players so that the DM can see what they're
        thinking. It helps planning, so thanks players for having conversations
        throughout the week. I knew that 4 hours of work wouldn't be wasted.

      text: The Token Tool (https://www.rptools.net/toolbox/token-tool/) is what I use
        to create tokens. It takes a few seconds to take an image and create a
        token for use. I haven't quite gotten to the point where I've printed
        off tokens to create magnets, but the possibilities are there. Kudos to
        the creators of this tools as I have used it extensively.
  heading: An Open Approach
  description: My approach is to keep an open mind. I know some people through
    around the work "railroading" as a term where you restrict your players to a
    predefined path. While it is nice to have a predictable setting, that might
    not work with all of your players.

    There are a number of great resources available to help anyone with creating
    a campaign for any setting. I'll show you some of the ones I've found to be
    helpful. I'll demonstrate how I've used them and where I've applied them.
