  including the game master. For me, this has been an opportunity to engage with
  old friends and meet new ones. Building worlds and exploring the depth of
  vocabulary as I attempt to create a dynamic setting of characters has allowed
  me to explore new avenues of growth. "

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
