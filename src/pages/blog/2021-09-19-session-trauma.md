A happy turn of events happened as the session started. The players that played Nysvyre, Amelrelle, and Amaranth were late. This opportunity was something that I wanted to have happen anyway and I seized the moment. I quickly told the two players that we were starting and cut the conversations off where they were.

Marius rushed up the stairs with Cora in tow, Ijaia wrestled unsuccessfully to grapple Marius. At the crest of the stairs, the trio came face-to-face with Governor Nighthill and a gathering of shields and spears pointed to the stairs. 

Marius pleaded with Governor Nighthill, “The adventurers have turned against us! They killed Escobert and are trying to kill me now! Only Cora still stands with me. Tell them, Cora. Tell them that Ijaia attacked me!” Governor Nighthill looked toward Cora who could only nod. Ijaia tried to contest, but rolled poorly. Governor Nighthill ordered the guards to bind Ijaia. 

With this, I ended the first part of the session as the rest of the players began logging on. I don’t know how this fortune came my way, but it provided an amazing opportunity. Amelrelle darts from the dungeon in pursuit of Marius and Ijaia. Her roguish agility pulled her through the faint torchlight and up the stairs. Before her stood Ijaia and the shield of guards approaching. They reacted to the new arrival. Again, she pleaded against Marius and said that he had attacked Escobert with magic. Another failed persuasion check.

Then, Amaranth comes to the top of the stairs. Before Amaranth can speak, Governor Nighthill exclaims, “Amaranth, you will submit yourself to be bound!” Ijaia was already being chained with manacles. Amaranth accepted as Amelrelle was chained. (DM MISTAKE) When the chains were placed around Amaranth, I had Amaranth suffer a level of madness. I did this because druids cannot wear metal armor and thought this was an interesting extension. However, I had not considered the nature of this rule. With this Amaranth’s madness caused him to fall silent for the next 10 minutes (DM MISTAKE).

As Marius disappeared out the front door, the others were marched to Governor Nighthill’s chamber. Marius knew that his deception would only last a short while and Cora’s charm was bound to expire within the hour. While in Marius’ chamber, the trio was interrogated. Two guards then went into the basement to find Nysvyre and retrieve Escobert’s body. Once there, they found Nysvyre assisting Escobert. The guards ordered him to stop. The confrontation, as expected, went poorly. This time, not because of rolling, but because Nysvyre has a tendency to speak down to everyone.

He ordered them to stand down, they ordered them to stand down, conflict was on the horizon and the dawn was coming. Nysvyre finally succeeded in his intimidation, ordering the pair to take him to Governor Nighthill (not so coincidently the place they were to take him nevertheless). Escobert and Nysvyre raced through the keep to find Governor Nighthill in an aggravating conversation with the trio who were simply not rolling well on persuasion. Probably the worst rolls of the campaign. Then Nysvyre arrived, out for blood.

The guard at the door stood aside as Nysvyre burst through the door with Escobert. In an instant, the deception was clear. Escobert, the defender of the keep, told him that Marius had betrayed them all. Governor Nighthill felt ashamed as he released the prisoners. They departed as Governor Nighthill ordered the guards to raise alarms if Marius was seen.

The party departed the keep, but had no clue which direction to go. I provided no advice and let them try to figure out what to do themselves. It was Amaranth who had the first idea. He asked if there were any birds around. I mentioned that there were several crows who had made there way to take advantage of the disarray of the town. He approached to ask a favor. At first, he offered them food, but there was plenty of food. Here’s where things get interesting.

Amaranth pondered what the bird would want and he offered a gold coin. The crow approached, the greed reflecting the crow’s eye. He wouldn’t be satisfied if only he was given the gold. There would have to be gold for the each bird. “One gold per bird,” the crow conveyed. Amaranth, never knowing the worth of coin, presented 15 gold coins to the murder of crows. The rest of the party realized that Amaranth should never be given a coinpurse. Amelrelle took it upon herself to be her steward (to which Amaranth/player agreed without coercion). 

The birds flew up and quickly spied the fat halfling running beside the human. “There!” the crows squawked and the party took off in that direction. The spell surrounding Cora faded as she regained her senses. Choosing not to give any indication that the spell had faded, she probed Marius for answers. Marius relayed that Cora knew what it was like to have the taste of power. He didn’t think that the cultists were smart enough to know what power was. He asked Cora to come with him somewhere special to gain more power. They continued to flee together.

In time, Amelrelle outpaced everyone. Making gains on Marius, Amelrelle caught the pair. One devastating hit brought Marius to his knees. Cora stood ready to fight Marius who sat there, waiting. Amelrelle and Cora deliberated what to do as Amelrelle indicated that she wanted to kill Marius. Cora, without hesitation, cast seaing bolts at Marius. The magic blasting Marius’ body. His lifeless husk tumbled to the ground as the rest of the crew finally arrived. As the body fell, Cora heard a voice deep within her mind, “Good. Here’s another taste of power!” A chill overcame her as she fell unconscious. 

The party carried Marius’ corpse back to Greenest, Cora being carried by Ijaia. After nearly an hour of walking, Cora finally woke up. There were some questions as the party came to terms with the fact that the source of their information was just killed. The end to the long walk was met by governor Nighthill and Escobert. While the governor was not enthusiastic to see that Marius had been killed, he understood that in the moment things happen. There are worse things at hand. Governor Nighthill requested that the party help with getting more information about the cult.

As this conversation was happening, a young monk came into view. His arm and leg were bandaged. He looked desperate as he limped into the keep. He told governor Nighthill that his mentor Leosin Erlanthar is missing. In fact, he thinks that Leosin was taken by the cultists. While Nesim, this young monk, doesn’t have much to offer, he was sure that he could find something to repay their kindness.

With the session ending here, there was more than enough for the party to think about. The plot hook with Cora was pretty interesting I felt. With the party asking questions, there is enough for the party to do some epic role-playing in the next few sessions.
