  title: Torch and Wait
  description: Come take a break with us in between your campaigns and find out
    what we've been doing. Lay aside your torch and rest for a bit. Perhaps
    you'll enjoy a story or two.
description: "One of the appeals of roleplaying games is the focus on the
  interaction between players. For me, this has been an opportunity to engage
  with old friends and meet new ones. Building worlds and exploring the depth of
  vocabulary as I attempt to create a dynamic setting of characters has allowed
  me to explore new avenues of growth. "

      text: My approach is to keep an open mind. I know some people through around the
        work "railroading" as a term where you restrict your players to a
        predefined path. While it is nice to have a predictable setting, that
        might not work with all of your players.

      text: Miniatures are a fun way to indulge in Dungeons and Dragons or other
        tabletop games. While I haven't had much use for them online, I have
        purchased a number that I would like to show off. I am by no means a
        professional painter, but I hope you enjoy looking through them.

      text: Battlemaps are one of the things that I have made great use of since
        starting dungeons and dragons. I have made many of my own to fill
        different needs. Here, I talk about the resources I've used and some of
        the maps that I have.

        I'll also present some of the homebrew concepts that I plan to use in my
        game.

    Wanting to provide the best gaming experience for players involves high
    points, such as beating a hard enemy or humorous interactions between
    players or npcs, and low points, such as player deaths or dramatic
    resolutions. This is something I've had to learn, but I don't know if it
    works for everyone.
