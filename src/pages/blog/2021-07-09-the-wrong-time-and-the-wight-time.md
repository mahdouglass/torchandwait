Each episode, I try to give the characters an opportunity to describe something that they would do. This allows the players to give the characters life and prevent them from being just a sheet of paper (or code). My player’s interactions with each other are probably the best part of the game. It’s what I love about being a DM. However, there still needs to be a balance to keep the story moving. Finding the role-playing element in this episode was easy: the dawn.



When the players woke up the next morning, I had them describe what activities they would typically do. The reasoning for this would be that this was the first rest that they have had since arriving to Greenest. Having been awake well past midnight, they would be exhausted. In that exhaustion, I expected that they would fall back on hesitant routines. First, Nysvyre is a paladin of the order of Tyr. Therefore, each morning he has a prayer that he performs. So, once he had finished his necessary sleep (required for a long rest), he went into a room to pray. To accommodate this, there was a store room for weapons that had basically been ransacked since the cult attacked the town. This made enough room for him and his prayer.



Next, I flashed to Cora. Cora took the time in the morning to write letters to her family. This was simple enough and didn’t require much more explaining. Thereafter were the remaining three, Amaranth, Amelrelle, and Ijaia. Amaranth, using Sentry’s rest, requires 4 hours of “meditation”. This means he was awake a full two hours before everyone else. However, he spent this time guarding Amelrelle to make sure that she was safe. Once Amelrelle and Ijaia were awake, they decided that they would immediately go and look for food.



The food at the keep was basically the bare minimum. Mushed oats of some kind with whatever store remained. This was not particularly appetizing. Ijaia made sure to grab herself some food for herself and Cora. She returned to the room. Meanwhile, Amelrelle and Amaranth walked out of the keep. Amaranth wanted to return the favor to a hawk that he had befriended to let him know if anything had come or gone into the passageway. He was reluctant to do it during the night, but now he could go with reports that most of the cultists had already made their way from the city.



When they entered the courtyard, there was a commotion. A number of individuals had already congregated at the gate where clerics were covering a body with drapings. There had obviously been some combat that the party had missed. Approaching, the Amelrelle and Amaranth were told that a woman and two children were presented at the gate at the sunrise. Langdedrosa Cyanwrath demanded that a champion come to face him, alone and unaided. If a champion presented himself, the three would be freed.



One of the guards recognized the three as family members and accepted the challenge. The combat was hardly equal as the half-dragon made quick work of the guard. Beheaded, the guard had paid the cost for the three prisoners. The cultists left after the deed and celebrated in their usual manner.



This is an occurrence in the campaign that the characters can encounter if they choose not to sleep during the night. However, since the party chose to sleep, they inevitably missed the combat. However, one thing that I knew about my party is that they have a strong sentiment of “doing good”. Thus, providing information about what was lost by making a choice is something that I choose to make important. While it could be argued that it takes time to address something that would have little significance overall, I enjoy stressing the narrative. If you sit something out, there will still be consequences.



Amaranth and Amelrelle went to see their bird immediately after this. They couldn’t rush it because they were still in their “restful state” of the long rest. Meeting the bird wouldn’t be that stressful. As Amaranth approached the grove of trees where the hawk had been met, it descended towards him.



“Where have you been!?” the hawk demanded. “A creature walked into that tunnel during the still of the night and has not come out.”



While Amaranth has “speech of the woods”, I find it hard to simplify what is being communicated. So, I just end up saying what I mean anyway. It’s better dialogue for me.



Thanking the hawk with more jerky, Amelrelle and Amaranth went back to the tunnel. The lock had never been set and the grate stood ajar. They entered into the tunnel and upon reaching the dungeon of the keep, found that two of the guards had been killed. Amelrelle crept slowly beyond the dungeon gates, sneaking into the narrow passageway that led by the individual cells. She saw a man hiding underneath a bed and listened carefully. She heard begging and the sound of a sword slashing.



Amelrelle reeled back out of the dungeon and grabbed Amaranth. Together, they went up the stairs to get the rest of the party. In their various states, they were ready to go (also, because the other players heard that all this was happening. So, of course). Anyway, they also chose to get Governor Nighthill, Marius, and Escobert, telling them that two of the guards in the basement had been killed. They all hurried down and found the guards on the ground. After a quick inspection, they found that they had been tainted by some kind of magic. They sought to move deeper into the dungeon.



In the area, there were two rats. I had placed these in the room ages ago, but the party never really tried to interact with them. These were different from the giant rats, which they had fought. Amaranth, however, tried to talk to these regular sized rats. Interestingly enough, they did not respond back in the way that Amaranth would expect. In an instant, the rats changed into imps and immediately attacked.



With most of the party investigating the bodies and trying to get into the doorway, there was little room for maneuvering. Amaranth and Cora mostly took care of the imps. In fact, they destroyed the imps with little afterthought. A little bit of narrative here: I know that there are many ways to play this, but I thought that the rats changing into imps instead of remaining as rats and fighting felt better. There was already something ominous happening and it felt appropriate. However, I will note that I did not pay close enough attention to remember that the imps have damage resistance. The fight should have been harder. But that’s okay.



During the fighting, Governor Nighthill takes off back upstairs. Escobert and Marius remained with the party as they now were maneuvering deeper into the dungeon. There were two gates. As Nysvyre and Marius passed the second gate, they could now hear the screams of prisoners. I had Marius roll a wisdom save behind the scenes and he failed. Marius went into a panic, not wanting to go deeper into the dungeon. As the door opened into the dungeon, Marius backed into the gate and basically closed it. In an effort to flee, he prevented the rest of the party from entering. As this point, I had enemies starting to approach the hall.



This is where the episode goes crazy. Everyone is having their characters try to persuade, intimidate, push, pull, or do whatever they can to get Marius to move. Everyone rolled garbage! Finally, they succeed in intimidating him to move forward. By this time, the first zombie appeared in the hall. Nysvyre charged with great anticipation exclaiming, “This is why I built this character!” The zombie didn’t put up much of a fight as the party started wailing on it. As a DM, I was disappointed that it didn’t make its constitution saving throw to revive, but another zombie was coming.



The music I chose for this was dark and desperate. As the characters came around the dungeon, another zombie came into view. Lumbering towards the party, the zombie was already taking some damage. It managed to slam against Nysvyre before being cut down with radiant damage. Then, the bass drops.



An undead soldier with bow and sword comes around and launches arrows at the party with its longbow. Arrows sunk deep into Amelrelle and Nysvyre. Amaranth charges in and starts healing. Escobert gets into position. Cora and Ijaia are at the back.



“Cora, Ijaia, let’s get out of here,” Marius exclaims as he casts charm person. With both failing their wisdom saving throws, two members of the party could be considered defeated. This was a little more troubling than I wanted and so I used a less than subtle DM trick. As Escobert already hated Marius, he pushed Ijaia into Marius causing Ijaia’s charm to break. The fight happening would already be challenging enough without two of the party members.



Marius recoils against Escobert and casts hellish rebuke on Escobert and deals a massive amount of damage. Escobert falls unconscious. Ijaia tries to stop Cora and Marius but fails to do so. Meanwhile, the rest of the party is exchanging blows with the wight and trying to determine if Marius was his master. He was not. The wight was dealing damage and taking half damage. It was a close fight and could have been worse. The encounter was definitely deadly for the party, but I wanted them to sweat a bit. This moment was supposed to be significant.



In time, the wight fell. Cora and Marius had already taken off from the dungeon. Ijaia chased every step of the way. The party checked with Escobert who managed to awaken, but needed a breather. Amelrelle the swift barreled through the dungeon to catch up to the trio. Amaranth, not as fast, chased after. Nysvyre inspected the wight, finding a magical ring that he slipped on his finger. He bound himself to it. A cursed ring of protection. I didn’t tell the rest of the party that it was cursed, but just that Nysvyre required two rations per day or he would gain a level of exhaustion.



This episode was quite interesting for me in that it introduced a lot at once. There were so many breadcrumbs at this point that shouldn’t have made sense to the characters at the time. As I’ve DM’d more and look back, I’ve learned how to tie story elements in better. I’m not sure if the party ever discovered the purpose of the wight, but Marius caused a significant distraction. With that, the party had something to look forward to in the coming week.
