*[Spoilers for Hoard of the Dragon Queen](https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/hotdq)*

![](/img/ddhoardofthedragonqueen.jpg "Hoard of the Dragon Queen (Play your own campaign with this manual!)")

In my last post, I mentioned that I had started my campaign with my wife and three people who I hardly knew. The creation of the characters was something that I glossed over for the sake of the players and not revealing much of the backstories in case those players read this. However, I did want to introduce them a little bit for the sake of the people who are not in the campaign reading this.

**Ijaia**: The Goliath bard. A formidable woman driven out of her tribe for being a dreamer. Wandering far to the West of Faerun toward the Sword Coast, Ijaia fell into the company of Cora and became a bodyguard. Perhaps they mistook the bard for a barbarian.

**Cora Roundbottom**: A halfling warlock. She wants so badly to be a sorcerer like her brother, but had to do something else to get that power. Going off on an adventure later in life, her parents sought for her to have a bodyguard. Spying a wandering Goliath and paying for her bodyguard services, Cora found herself in the company of Ijaia.

**Amelrelle**: A Half-Elf Rogue. Finding unique powers in her youth, she found herself at a slave auction. When her powers manifested, she was able to escape. She found companionship with Amaranth. Years past before the adventure begins. That recent history remains a secret.

**Amaranth (token shown in thumbnail, unknown link)**: A Wooden Warforged druid. His long history is clouded by an injury that remains unhealed. Having traded hands for years in the slave trade, Amaranth finally found companionship with Amelrelle and escaped with her.

I had the characters roll for stats. While this can definitely result in god-like characters, part of it is nice as having the unpredictability of the fates force interesting scenarios. For instance, Amaranth rolled a 5. While his other stats are quite high, the 5 was quite the deviation. So where does a druid put a 5? Into intelligence of course. It played well into his character though. The 5 is justified as a substantial injury that caused Amaranth to forget many of the skills he had accrued in his past, with his history being a blur. Thus, this seemingly immortal being can exist in the world while still having to start from level 1.

Each of the characters rolled decently, telling them to roll 4d6 and drop the lowest. If the total sum was less than 70 than they should reroll. Why 70? With 6 stats, I wasn’t worried about extreme numbers. On average, you can have pretty high numbers offset by low numbers. The alternative was that if they rolled poorly, but managed to roll an 18 (something everyone gets excited about) they could add the remaining points required to reach 70 to the lowest score. If you have an 18 and still are not at 70, you’re probably going to play a glass cannon. Some people like that, I’m not going to discourage it.

While the character creation went smoothly, my wife had some difficulty deciding what to do. This is because she still didn’t have much understanding about her character. The key here is “managed expectations”. I didn’t immediately expect my wife to become entirely obsessed with understanding her character. I picked a couple of support spells for her. Healing word, bane, sleep, and vicious mockery for good measure. She didn’t know what bardic inspiration was, but that’s okay. It’s the intro to the campaign, how hard could it be? We’ll get to that.

When I started the campaign, I had Ijaia matched up with Cora and Amelrelle matched up with Amaranth. They seemed like natural pairs in the game and out. I began working with the backstories of the characters, setting up what the characters wanted to do and become. In other words, what are their ambitions, vices, and fears. That way, I could create daggers in the stories. I’ve heard daggers described as elements that connect a character’s past to their future. Sometimes this is a roadblock, a realization of their past, an old friend who never really was, etc. This was important as I could taunt the characters in game to do things. It also introduced elements of roleplaying beyond simple combat encounters.

I worked with each of the players to establish their backstories for some time before the game and after. I realized in creating (but never using) my own characters that they became important to me. I want it to hurt when they die. I want the players to be careful. That a bad decision for their characters may mean something. I don’t know much about the players in the world, but from what I’ve read online, this isn’t a common sentiment. But for my games, that’s what I want. It’s a lot to ask. Luckily, my players are awesome and have tolerated my pestering.

When the game started, I started with Ijaia and Cora. It was a simple decision as you really have to start somewhere. Ijaia chose to have a pan flute so I found a track of The Shire played on the panflute. It helped set a decent mood for the game as the pair traveled with a merchant and his son. After some simple dialogue, everything stopped. The merchant fell to his knees as he saw the flames over Greenest. Miles away still, the sun was just setting. There they stood. The son approached his father, begging him to go help them. The father looks back and starts crying. He knew he couldn't leave his son behind and he couldn't take his son in there. The son calls his father a coward and turns towards Ijaia and Cora. This helped compel the pair to go into the besieged hamlet. A failed persuasion roll from Cora meant that not only did the merchant withhold potions of healing, but he refused to budge. The pair made there way towards the village. 

We then flashed to Amelrelle and Amaranth. Journeying south-east from the Wood of Sharp Teeth, they came upon a town burning. A successful perception check from Amaranth (one of the seasoned players) revealed a family running from the town and hiding in a ditch. Amaranth runs towards the trio and finds a father severely wounded and the son burned. The mother was in a panic and everyone was hurting. They were in a cellar when the house was set on fire and managed to barely escape. The son was hardly breathing and a successful medicine check allowed Amaranth to help. This wooden golem figure was unsettling to the trio, and the father tried to resist. However, Amaranth was unmoving. Their apprehension subsided as he reached to help them. They were in pretty dire straights. They said that they needed to get help from the keep and that is where they would have gone if the path wasn't blocked. Thus, Amaranth and Amelrelle made their way into the hamlet.

At this point, I could have had the two pairs arrive at different parts of the conflict. However, having no experience about the threat that enemies actually served, I thought it was better that the pairs converged. Rather than taking the main road, the pairs arrived near what I called a graveyard in the northwest sector of the townmap. Bear in mind though, my interpretation of this is that for a HAMLET to have a KEEP means that the town had to have at least 1500 people. The town map does not represent this and so I expanded on the town. 

As the group arrived at town, they had a brief stint where they had to decide whether the opposing pair were enemies. It wasn't hard for them to determine that they weren't enemies. Perhaps being in the same voice chat would help that determination. Immediately after that, they heard a scream. A family was fleeing from a number of kobolds. A father with three children and a mother. Kobold slings leapt forth through the air as the party sprang to action. Bolts and spells split the air as the kobolds stood no chance. Cora managed to roll impressively, taking down most of the kobolds single-handedly. But wait, one kobold left and the party decides to interrogate it? You betcha. Out pops the sleep spell. Amaranth and the kobold begin to cuddle. After some sleight of hand to decouple the pair, they tie up the kobold. 

At this point, there was enough guidance in the campaign to illustrate how a kobold would respond in this circumstance. Very annoyingly, very uninformative, and pretty much a yes-man. They decide to stow the kobold in the very house that Linen and her family escaped from. No looting was done to the fallen kobolds. However, Ijaia did recover her bolts. The party licked their wounds having taken some shots from the kobolds. 

A brief conversation with Linen and her family showed that they needed to get to the keep. The party began the escort and managed to succeed on stealthing. They saw a group of individuals, a red robed individual, a purple robed individual, and a couple of kobolds. They wait for them to pass. They continue south. At this point, they hear screaming. A few kobolds and a purple robe and red robe were busy sacking houses. The party was exposed. This fight ended quickly, but the purpled robed individual sent a kobold with a message. While the cultists all died, the kobold with the message escaped. 

Humorous event happened though. Amaranth wanted to interrogate the cultists and spare them. But, he said this in Elvish. Ijaia and Cora don't speak Elvish. Now, you know when you have a great player who can understand their character. She didn't know what was said and just killed the cultist. What would you expect from a warlock that was rolling such high damage the whole night? Amelrelle wanted to pursue the kobold, but held back. 

What the party didn't understand at this point was that Mondath was at the south of town. The kobold was sent with a message that adventurers were in the town heading towards the keep. This would trigger the event for the next session. The group went to the keep and found that much of the town was gathered. Some were dead with coins placed on their eyes (players didn't ask why). Tears and fear were palpable in the keep. After a brief, agitated conversation with Amaranth, the guards directed the party to governor Nighthill. I had been practicing my Winston Churchill accent for a while. Speaking with a droopy lip and slow speech, the party finally reached a stopping point. 

It was a quick session to me. There was a lot of tracking of health (I rolled health for each enemy, initiative for each enemy, and damage for each attack). Some of the enemies were already hurt. This allowed for the party to make use of perception checks that helped them in combat. Otherwise, why use an action to do so? There were a lot of things I learned during my first session ever. There was a lot of dead air as the party is full of introverts. Only one of my party, my wife, had met each of the players. You could tell that no one wanted to step on each other's toes. In time, I hoped, this would go away as each person became more familiar with their characters and the other players. 

In the end, I had more fun than I had for most of the quarantine. It was safe, engaging, stretched my creativity, and allowed me to interact with others. I knew that I had to do this more. It was awesome.
