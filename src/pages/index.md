  title: Torch and Wait
  description: A "Wait" is an archaic term for a town guard. So come take a break
    with us during your campaigns and find out what we've been doing. Lay aside
    your torch and rest for a bit. Perhaps you'll enjoy a story or two.
description: "Roleplaying games focus on the interaction between players,
  including the game master. For me, this has been an opportunity to engage with
  old friends and meet new ones. Building worlds and exploring the depth of
  vocabulary as I attempt to create a dynamic setting of characters has allowed
  me to explore new avenues of growth. "

        work "railroading" as a term where you restrict your players to a
        predefined path. While it is nice to have a predictable setting, that
        might not work with all of your players.

      text: Miniatures are a fun way to indulge in a dungeons and dragons. While I

        hope you enjoy looking through them.

      text: Battlemaps are one of the things that I have made great use of since
        starting dungeons and dragons. I have made many of my own to fill
        different needs. Here, I talk about the resources I've used and some of
        the maps that I have.

        I'll also present some of the homebrew concepts that I plan to use in my
        game.
