      text: DNDbeyond (https://www.dndbeyond.com/) is one of the greatest resources
        that I have had to use during my campaign. My campaign uses DNDbeyond to
        manage character sheets and roll dice. I use this tool extensively to
        create homebrew material that is then available to the players. This
        helps stay organized and helps when a player isn't present to manage
        their sheet.

        We offer a small, but carefully curated selection of brewing gear and
        tools for every taste and experience level. No matter if you roast your
        own beans or just bought your first french press, you’ll find a gadget
        to fall in love with in our shop.

        Love a great cup of coffee, but never knew how to make one? Bought a
        fancy new Chemex but have no clue how to use it? Don't worry, we’re here
        to help. You can schedule a custom 1-on-1 consultation with our baristas
        to learn anything you want to know about coffee roasting and brewing.
        Email us or call the store for details.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
  heading: An Open Approach
  description: My approach is to keep an open mind. I know some people through
    around the work "railroading" as a term where you restrict your players to a
    predefined path. While it is nice to have a predictable setting, that might
    not work with all of your players.

    There are a number of great resources available to help anyone with creating
    a campaign for any setting. I'll show you some of the ones I've found to be
    helpful. I'll demonstrate how I've used them and where I've applied them.

    quote: The first time I tried Kaldi’s coffee, I couldn’t even believe that was
      the same thing I’ve been drinking every morning.

    quote: Kaldi is the place to go if you want the best quality coffee. I love
      their stance on empowering farmers and transparency.
