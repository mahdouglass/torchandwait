Decisions in the game are often difficult to judge. While many people I've talked with ascribed to "just make it fun", the question of "fun" is difficult. Some people want to steamroll opponents while others enjoy a challenge. For me, those difficult decisions often meet the chance of dice. Meeting certain enemies at certain locations or whether the opponent can see through your lies are rolled. Some of the conflicts are written of course, some are more random. The party has the opportunity to avoid many of these "random" encounters, but they have to make the right decisions to do so.

As the party wanted to go back into the keep through the Old Tunnel, Ijaia, Amelrelle, and Amaranth
decided to lead the front of the group. Cora and Nysvyre decided to hang back. Part of this was because
Cora and Nysvyre wanted to talk to Ol’ Marius and figure out what was going on with him. The other
were convinced that they should probably stick to the front because the DM said something that alluded
to danger. It was probably bad form.


As they entered into the Old Tunnel, they made a perception check. As they looked at the floor of the
tunnel, they found footprints that led inward. This should have raised some alarms, but it didn’t seem to
faze them much. They continued into the keep and when they reached the basement, they led the
thronging mass up the stairs.


Cora and Nysvyre were questioning Marius about what he was doing or where he had gone. Why had he
managed to get to Greenest just in time when it seemed that the conflict was unexpected. He had
mentioned that he had gone out looking for something important and that he felt it was time to come
home. He didn’t really elaborate, but I felt as though most of the things he said were plausible. Neither
of the pair seemed to really doubt him much and insight checks didn’t yield much new information.
That being said, with newer players or players out-of-practice, I am always surprised when story threads
aren’t picked up on. Cora already knew something was up because I had told her directly. Most of the
players at this point probably thought that Marius was a quest-giver. He was not. In fact, Cora didn’t
have to kill him. She didn’t HAVE to do anything to him. The story could simply have ignored Marius and
move on, but fate always comes calling.


As the masses entered the keep, they began rushing through the final leg of the journey. Up the keep
they were and stormed the rooms. Clamor could be heard throughout the halls as weeping tears of joy
and sadness were shared. People looking for loved ones, people searching for comfort, or even looking
for food.


The players were pretty quick in deciding that they need to find governor Nighthill. They were led to
governor Nighthill at the parapet where he was in discussion with Escobert. They were in an argument
about what needed to be done about the cultists. The two were in agreement that something needed to
be done and that they needed to get more information. This is when the group, including Marius,
entered the room.


It was clear from the beginning that Marius and Escobert were not going to get along. With Marius
antagonistic toward Escobert, this may it easy to give Marius a hook. Marius emphasized that Escobert
could do anything to help the town and that he had obviously failed as governor Nighthill’s defender of
the keep. Marius is educated and finds that Escobert is an easy target. The conversation escalates and
governor Nighthill steps in. He leads the party to the hill and indicates that it would be good to take one
of the individuals in the purple robes prisoner for interrogation. During this, he points out Frulam
Mondath wearing her purple regalia.


“The purple robes seem to denote the higher in command. If you would, take one of them captive for
interrogation. I’d like to speak with them personally.” The group, having already killed a purple robed
cultist, regretted their earlier decision and now it was time for them to go out again. It wasn’t the worst,
but Nysvyre had already taken a hit or two and healing was running low. They asked Governor Nighthill
for some healing. Failed persuasion check. He indicated that the priests were already spent healing most of the town. Not only that, but their check was so low that the governor didn’t even offer his healing
potions. Shame, but Cora took the moment to further increase her distaste of governor Nighthill.
The party went back out of the keep and ventured to the northeast. This time, they were trying to keep
their distance of the mill, of which it seemed they were not interested in protecting. Luckily, I had
created a number of maps. In this area, they crept forward and stealthily went about their business.
There was a group of cultists that they could hear, thanks to being sneaky, and set about a plan of
action.


Again, Nysvyre would go out and pose as a cultist. He found that there was, conveniently, a purple
robed individual amongst them. Amelrelle would try to play dead while everyone else lay in ambush.
Nysvyre would call for help and try to pull them over. As Nysvyre chatted and was drawing their
attention that one of their own had been attacked, Cora stuck her head to look. In doing so, there was
clear line of sight between Cora and a guard. Why? Because the guard was already walking that
direction, was alerted to danger (thanks Nysvyre), and Cora was not discrete. Roll initiative.


Combat was quick. The party rolled damage pretty well. Amelrelle chose to play dead for a number of
rounds. As the cult’s numbers grew thin, one of the them tried to flee. Cora wanted to use a special
melee attack to trip the target as he fled. She succeeded. Her was knocked prone and stood up. Ijaia
drew her crossbow and shot him in the leg. They tied up the purple robed one who stood down and tied
up the one that tried to get away. Easy as pie. This wasn’t meant to be a hard challenge, but it could
have been. The encounter took place in 1/10 of the map that I had created. There were other cultists
and kobolds around if they didn’t succeed in NOT killing the purple robed one. Obviously, the more
fighting meant that there would be more chances for getting hit. It would turn out that the party is
much more risk averse than previously expected. I’m both happy and sad about this, but more happy
than sad.


As the party returned to the keep, one of the things that they did was another perception check to see if
there were any new tracks in the Old Tunnel. By this time, since the number of people that had gone
through the tunnel was much larger than could be reasonably expected, it was difficult to tell if there
was anything “new”. The party made their way back into the keep and took the cultists to governor
Nighthill’s cabinet chamber. There, governor Nighthill was still meeting with the priest of the sanctuary,
Escobert, and Marius. As the party drew the cultists into the chamber, governor Nighthill looked them
up and down before having the guards take them to the dungeon. The interrogation would happen
soon, but there were other pressing matters. The guards were still fighting at the walls of the keep.
Villagers needed to be saved. Governor Nighthill’s exhaustion was beginning to show.


The party asked if there was a place they could rest while they waited for the interrogation. This was
further proof that they were not interested in helping the mill, but that’s okay. Governor Nighthill sent
them to the guard’s room where a number of guards were already at rest. Guards around the keep were
exhausted, some seated on the ground, weeping against the wall. The sudden arrival of the cult, the
dragon, and the loss of life, had taken its toll. Now, the adventurer’s found their place, a few cozy beds,
and drifted off to sleep. Amaranth didn’t require sleep, but still required his 4 hours of Sentry’s Rest.
While the commotion continued to stir around them, they drifted off to sleep. Perhaps they stirred due
to worry. Perhaps they fell quickly unconscious due to fatigue or injury.

The decisions of the party were interesting to me. The fact that they went to sleep without helping the
rest of the town, seeing what was happening at the mill, or even standing watch to make sure nothing
significant happened. There were things happening in the keep that they didn’t discover, such as who
had gone into the keep, what they were doing there, and the missed clues that went unfound.
One of the clues that they could have found is that when they reached the keep from the Old Tunnel,
there were some rats that had taken refuge in the ruined preserves and grains. Amaranth could have
talked to these rats and found out that a couple of odd looking men dressed in red robes had come into
the keep. While the direct translation of this would have had to be conveyed in simple “rat” gestures,
the fact was that men who weren’t supposed to be in the keep were in the keep. But, the consequence
of this would have to wait until the morning.
