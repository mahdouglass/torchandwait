title: Who Am I
---
My name is Alexander. Having grown up with video games, I've always been fascinated with stories and puzzles. Naturally, my personality pulled me towards role-playing games. Never having the type of friends who would play these games or even have many friends to play games with, I still managed to immerse myself in single player games like Final Fantasy and Skyrim. As MMOs became more common, this didn't change for me as I still had difficulty stepping out of my comfort zone. There are many games out there I still want to try, but making friends as an adult is definitely tricky.

**Education**

I got my bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics, a minor in Economics. Then, I continued to get my Ph. D in Mechanical Engineering. What does this mean for gaming, probably nothing.

**Home**

I have a beautiful wife who was the first player who agreed to participate in my first campaign. I also have an awesome, 1-year-old son who has graciously agreed to sleep at night and allow us to play. Unfortunately, I do have to shut my office door to prevent my two cats from walking over my plans during gameplay.

**Hobbies**

I always enjoy creating games. Probably the most exciting thing that I am working on is an Augmented Reality play setting for tabletop games. While this exists on a monitor, I'm working on making this a reality for the hololens.
